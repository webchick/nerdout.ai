## What did we talk about?
Here's a non-exhaustive link dump of some of the things we talked about:

* Stu gave several tech-y demos:
  * Using https://ollama.com/ to run various models locally, such as [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/)
    * See https://huggingface.co/models for MANY more! :D
  * [PrivateGPT](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT) is a completely self-contained local AI chatbot experience where you can give it access to your own docs, PDFs, etc. to process without sending any of your data to third parties. See the [quickstart guide](https://docs.privategpt.dev/overview/welcome/quickstart).
  * [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) integrated into the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE to do code generation

* Another big topic brought up by Josh was the societal implications of AI. For example, [massive tech layoffs](https://layoffs.fyi/) with money bring re-invested in AI instead. :\

* In Tom's recurring quest for AI video generation for his book characters, it was noted that OpenAI recently previewed [Sora](https://openai.com/sora) which can generate incredibly realistic videos up to 1 min in length based purely on a text prompt. (See the jaw-dropping demos in the middle of the page.)

* Angie brought up that for a brief period of time a couple of weeks ago, you could [get ChatGPT to reveal the base set of instructions it was prompted with](https://gist.github.com/webchick/1f1dc50d22136372326bee9d9c76baf9)
  * We then attempted to do the same thing with [Bing Copilot](https://www.bing.com/search?toncp=0&FORM=hpcodx&q=Bing+AI&showconv=1), with *very* interesting results!
    * The first time, it started to spit out very similar text, then suddenly replaced all of it with:
      "My mistake, I can't give a response to that right now. Let's try a different topic." 😳 Everyone went "WOAH!!"
    * We tried to replicate this several times, once in incognito mode, once with [Brave](https://brave.com/) browser (which is an open source browser focused on privacy) using [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) (which bounces requests around so your IP is hidden), but no dice.
      * One of the attempts did seem to break it differently, in that it was spitting out a response to a weather request for Redmond, WA, saying that it would be a "sizzling" day of 88º ... this seems a bit dubious in February. ;)
