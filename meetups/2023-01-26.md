## What did we talk about?
Here's a non-exhaustive link dump of some of the things we talked about:

* Stu gave a demo of [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) integrated into the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE — type some comments that describe what you want, and watch ChatGPT fill it in for you.
* Nel showed off [OpenHermes](https://huggingface.co/teknium/OpenHermes-2-Mistral-7B) — runs locally, better alternative to [Llama 2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/), and without the censorship / guardrails of ChatGPT.
* To run LLMs locally, we talked about using [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) (command line) or [Text generation web UI](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui). You can get models from:
  * [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) 
  * [Civitai](https://civitai.com/)
* [PyLadies](https://pyladies.com/) was recommended as an awesome group for women who want to learn more about the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language. There is a [PyLadies Vancouver](https://www.meetup.com/pyladies-vancouver/) chapter!
* Lots of talk about the intersection of AI and the arts:
  * Generating images: [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) (see [Showcase](https://legacy.midjourney.com/showcase/recent/) for some of what's possible)
  * Generating video: [Synthesia](https://www.synthesia.io/)
  * [Nightshade](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/23/1082189/data-poisoning-artists-fight-generative-ai/) is a way artists are fighting back from having their works used to train AI without their consent.
* Also talk of AI Ethics and legal frameworks. There are some folks working on this, for example the [EU Artificial Intelligence Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/)
