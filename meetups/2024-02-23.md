## What did we talk about?
Here's a non-exhaustive link dump of some of the things we talked about:

* **Lightning Demos**: Stu gave several tech-y demos:
  * Using https://ollama.com/ to run various models locally, such as [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/)
    * See https://huggingface.co/models for MANY more! :D
  * [PrivateGPT](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT) is a completely self-contained local AI chatbot experience where you can give it access to your own docs, PDFs, etc. to process without sending any of your data to third parties. See the [quickstart guide](https://docs.privategpt.dev/overview/welcome/quickstart).
  * [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) integrated into the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE to do code generation
     * We also discussed [codellama](https://github.com/facebookresearch/codellama), which offers similar functionality but can run locally.
  * [Gemini from Google](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/) which recently became available in Canada AND released [open models](https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemma-open-models/) â€” see [getting started](https://ai.google.dev/gemma) guide.

* **AI... Uh-oh... :\ **:  Another big topic brought up by Josh was the societal implications of AI. For example, [massive tech layoffs](https://layoffs.fyi/) with money bring re-invested in AI instead. :\
  * Another example of AI worries: most media is designed to make people feel like crap so they buy things to fix it. Right now the amount of these messages going out is somewhat tempered by human ability to produce them. AI will be able to do so not just much quicker, but also much more _individually personalized_ than before.
  * The [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) community was mentioned as part of this discussion. They are "focused on finding ways of doing good that actually work."
    * They too have [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/topics/effective-altruism/all) including [one in Vancouver](https://www.meetup.com/effective-altruism/) but it seems a bit stagnant atm.
  * OTOH, well meaning people can also over-correct. The recent [Flipper Zero ban](https://nationalpost.com/news/flipper-zero-banned-canada) by Canada was mentioned.
  * Stephen noted that one person who's done a lot of thinking on future of AI stuff, as well as future in stuff in general was [Robin Hanson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hanson) 

* **"Hacking" ChatGPT** Angie brought up that for a brief period of time a couple of weeks ago, you could [get ChatGPT to reveal the base set of instructions it was prompted with](https://gist.github.com/webchick/1f1dc50d22136372326bee9d9c76baf9)
  * We then attempted to do the same thing with [Bing Copilot](https://www.bing.com/search?toncp=0&FORM=hpcodx&q=Bing+AI&showconv=1), with *very* interesting results!
    * The first time, it started to spit out very similar text, then suddenly replaced all of it with:
      "My mistake, I can't give a response to that right now. Let's try a different topic." ðŸ˜³ Everyone went **"WOAH!!"**
    * We tried to replicate this several times to get a recording of it, once in incognito mode, once with [Brave](https://brave.com/) browser (which is an open source browser focused on privacy) using [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) (which bounces requests around so your IP is hidden), but no dice.
      * One of the attempts did seem to break it differently, in that it was spitting out a response to a weather request for Redmond, WA, saying that it would be a "sizzling" day of 88Âº ... this seems a bit dubious in February. ;) 

* **AI Video Generation** In Tom's ongoing quest for an AI video generation solution for his book characters, it was noted that OpenAI recently previewed [Sora](https://openai.com/sora) which can generate incredibly realistic videos up to 1 min in length based purely on a text prompt. (See the jaw-dropping demos in the middle of the page.)
  * Several members extremely correctly expressed concern about this technology being used to create misinformation. OpenAI is keenly aware of this, and [has deliberately engaged experts in malicious usage](https://openai.com/sora#safety) to test it and bang out the edge cases before it's released to the general public.

* **Building an AI-Powered Robot** We discussed a mascot for the group to make it easier to findâ€”like a giant plush robot to sit on the tableâ€”and then Muhammad pointed out that we could literally build a REAL robot, with a Raspberry Pi inside, that has a camera using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) to recognize when a human is approaching and a speaker that says "Hello!" upon approach. ðŸ¤£
  * This idea may or may not go anywhere, but Angie reached out to see if [Vancouver Hack Space](https://vanhack.ca/wp/) would be willing to be a host for a future meetup (~April?)

* **Keeping in touch** Either way though, folks expressed wanting a place to keep in touch between meetups (esp. since March's meetup is getting skipped due to travelâ€”sorry! ðŸ˜¬). Angie proposed using the #ai channel in the [Vancouver.dev Discord server](https://vancouver.dev/) as that's beginning to be a nice collection of Vancouver techy folks who are fairly active. The organizer, Toki also runs other [in-person events](https://lu.ma/vancouver.dev).
